# 2016 Presidential Election Campaign Hacking-CNN Research

<p align="justify"> This cyber-attack took place in 2015 and 2016, in which two groups of Russian computer hackers infiltrated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) computer network, leading to a data breach. This attack primarily involved hacking and releasing sensitive information related to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and key individuals associated with the Democratic Party.</p>

<p align="justify">The primary cyberattack method included the use of phishing emails to gain unauthorized access to email accounts and networks. The hackers then exfiltrated information and strategically released it through various online platforms, such as WikiLeaks, in an attempt to influence the election's outcome.
The discovery of vulnerabilities and attribution of the cyberattacks during the 2016 Presidential Election Campaign involved cybersecurity investigations by private firms, such as CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to investigate the breaches, as well as intelligence agencies like the CIA, FBI, and NSA, conducting assessments based on their investigations. The initial detection of cyber intrusions occurred when the DNC noticed unusual activity on its computer networks, prompting them to bring in cybersecurity experts to investigate the anomalies. Private cybersecurity firms collaborated with each other and with government agencies to analyze malware, tactics, and infrastructure used in the attacks.</p>

<p align="justify">The attackers, associated with Russian state-sponsored groups such as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, employed various tactics to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access. Phishing emails were a key component of the attackers' strategy. They also utilized advanced persistent threats, involving long-term and stealthy access to compromised systems. The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in software, particularly those related to email systems and servers.</p>

<p align="justify">Security measures that could have been implemented to reduce the risk and impact of such attacks include conducting regular cybersecurity awareness training for staff to educate them about phishing attacks and other social engineering tactics. Additionally, implementing multi-factor authentication across systems and applications, keeping all software, operating systems, and applications up to date with the latest security patches, implementing encryption for sensitive data both in transit and at rest, and working with cybersecurity experts and firms to conduct regular assessments, receive threat intelligence, and stay informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities.</p>

# Ukraine Ransomware - BBC Research

<p align="justify">This was a global cyber-attack that impacted various organizations. It appears to be a ransomware attack, with the malware spreading through corrupted updates of the Ukrainian accounting software MEDoc. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts files on a victim's computer, rendering them inaccessible. Attackers then demand a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, for the decryption key.</p>

<p align="justify">The process of discovering vulnerabilities involves a combination of technical analysis, user reports, and collaboration within the cybersecurity community. Cybersecurity experts might have initiated an incident response process after noticing unusual activities or disruptions in their networks, leading to the discovery of the compromised software. Also, automated systems are designed to detect anomalies in network behavior.</p>

<p align="justify">Common methods that attackers may use to exploit vulnerabilities include the use of social engineering techniques to trick users into downloading and executing malicious software. If the attackers compromised the automatic update mechanism of MEDoc, they could have injected malicious code into the legitimate update packages. Users who downloaded and installed these updates would unknowingly install the malware on their systems.</p>

Security measures that could be considered are:

1. Ensure that all software, including operating systems and applications, is regularly updated with the latest security patches.
2.	Conduct regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses in the organization's infrastructure and applications.
3.	Implement secure coding practices during software development.
4. Conduct regular cybersecurity awareness training for employees to educate them about phishing threats, social engineering, and the importance of verifying the legitimacy of software updates.
